print("\n1️⃣  TRAINING TARGET vs TRADING TARGET:")
print("   Training: 0.2% move in 10 min (easy to predict)")
print("   Trading:  0.6% profit before stop (harder to achieve)")
print("   → Lower win rate is expected!")

print("\n2️⃣  CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD:")
print("   Training: 55% (model's optimal)")
print("   Trading:  80% (ultra-selective)")
print("   → We only take the BEST 7% of signals")
print("   → 113 signals → 28 trades (after confirmation)")

print("\n3️⃣  ADDITIONAL FILTERS:")
print("   ✅ ADX ≥ 28 (strong trend only)")
print("   ✅ 10 AM - 2 PM (best hours only)")
print("   ✅ Confirmation candle (reduces false signals)")
print("   → These weren't in training but improve real trading")

print("\n4️⃣  RISK MANAGEMENT:")
print("   Training: No stops, just predict movement")
print("   Trading:  ATR-based stops, profit targets, trailing stops")
print("   → Real trading has risk management overhead")

print("   3. We have real risk management (stops, targets)")

print("   1. We win 2x more than we lose (0.47% vs 0.24%)")
print("   2. We only take the absolute best setups")
print("   3. We manage risk properly with ATR stops")
