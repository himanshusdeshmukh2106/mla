# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete intraday XGBoost trading strategy framework that enables users to build, train, and backtest machine learning-based trading models using high-frequency financial data. The system will provide end-to-end functionality from data acquisition and feature engineering to model training, prediction, and risk-managed strategy execution with comprehensive backtesting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want to set up a complete trading environment with all necessary dependencies, so that I can develop XGBoost-based trading strategies without manual configuration overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL automatically install and configure all required Python libraries (xgboost, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, pandas-ta, backtesting)
2. WHEN the environment setup is complete THEN the system SHALL verify all dependencies are properly installed and compatible
3. IF any dependency installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and installation guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to acquire and process high-frequency financial data, so that I can train my models on clean, properly formatted intraday data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data acquisition is requested THEN the system SHALL support importing 1-minute and 5-minute interval OHLCV data
2. WHEN raw data is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and identify missing or corrupted records
3. WHEN data validation is complete THEN the system SHALL clean the data by handling missing values and outliers
4. IF data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings and apply appropriate cleaning strategies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to engineer comprehensive technical features from raw price data, so that my XGBoost model has rich contextual information about market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature engineering is initiated THEN the system SHALL calculate trend indicators (SMA, EMA) with configurable periods
2. WHEN trend indicators are complete THEN the system SHALL compute momentum indicators (RSI, MACD) with standard parameters
3. WHEN momentum indicators are complete THEN the system SHALL generate volatility indicators (Bollinger Bands, ATR)
4. WHEN volatility indicators are complete THEN the system SHALL calculate volume-based indicators (OBV)
5. WHEN all indicators are calculated THEN the system SHALL remove rows with NaN values created by indicator calculations
6. IF indicator calculation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with available indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a machine learning practitioner, I want to define appropriate target variables for classification, so that my model can learn to predict profitable trading signals in noisy intraday markets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN target variable creation is requested THEN the system SHALL create binary classification targets (1 for price increase, 0 for price decrease)
2. WHEN binary targets are created THEN the system SHALL use next-period closing price comparison for labeling
3. WHEN target labeling is complete THEN the system SHALL remove the final row with undefined target value
4. IF target variable creation fails THEN the system SHALL raise an appropriate exception with diagnostic information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to split my time-series data chronologically for training and testing, so that I can evaluate model performance without look-ahead bias.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data splitting is requested THEN the system SHALL separate features from target variables and non-feature columns
2. WHEN feature separation is complete THEN the system SHALL split data chronologically without shuffling
3. WHEN chronological split is applied THEN the system SHALL use configurable test size ratio (default 20%)
4. WHEN data split is complete THEN the system SHALL report training and testing set sizes
5. IF data splitting fails due to insufficient data THEN the system SHALL raise an informative error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to train and optimize XGBoost models with proper hyperparameter tuning, so that I can achieve the best possible prediction accuracy for my trading strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model training is initiated THEN the system SHALL initialize XGBClassifier with binary logistic objective
2. WHEN model initialization is complete THEN the system SHALL define hyperparameter search grid including max_depth, learning_rate, n_estimators, and gamma
3. WHEN hyperparameter grid is defined THEN the system SHALL use TimeSeriesSplit for cross-validation to prevent look-ahead bias
4. WHEN cross-validation is configured THEN the system SHALL execute GridSearchCV with accuracy scoring
5. WHEN grid search is complete THEN the system SHALL return the best model with optimal hyperparameters
6. IF model training fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to evaluate my trained model's performance on out-of-sample data, so that I can assess the model's real-world trading potential before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model evaluation is requested THEN the system SHALL generate predictions on the test dataset
2. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
3. WHEN classification metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL generate a confusion matrix
4. WHEN performance metrics are complete THEN the system SHALL display feature importance rankings
5. IF model evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want to backtest my XGBoost strategy with realistic trading conditions, so that I can understand the strategy's historical performance and risk characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backtesting is initiated THEN the system SHALL implement a trading strategy class compatible with backtesting.py
2. WHEN strategy class is implemented THEN the system SHALL generate trading signals based on model predictions
3. WHEN trading signals are generated THEN the system SHALL apply configurable position sizing and risk management rules
4. WHEN risk management is applied THEN the system SHALL execute the backtest simulation with transaction costs
5. WHEN backtest simulation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive performance reports including returns, drawdown, and Sharpe ratio
6. IF backtesting fails THEN the system SHALL provide error details and suggest parameter adjustments

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want to implement position sizing and risk controls, so that the trading strategy operates within acceptable risk parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN risk management is configured THEN the system SHALL implement maximum position size limits
2. WHEN position limits are set THEN the system SHALL apply stop-loss and take-profit levels
3. WHEN stop levels are configured THEN the system SHALL implement maximum drawdown controls
4. WHEN drawdown controls are active THEN the system SHALL halt trading when risk limits are breached
5. IF risk limits are violated THEN the system SHALL log the violation and take appropriate protective action

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to save and load trained models and configurations, so that I can reuse successful strategies and maintain consistency across trading sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model saving is requested THEN the system SHALL serialize the trained XGBoost model to disk
2. WHEN model serialization is complete THEN the system SHALL save feature engineering configuration and parameters
3. WHEN configuration saving is complete THEN the system SHALL save hyperparameter settings and performance metrics
4. WHEN model loading is requested THEN the system SHALL restore the complete model state and configuration
5. IF model persistence operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
