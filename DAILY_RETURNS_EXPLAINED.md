# Daily Returns Explained

## 🤔 What Does "+2.11% over 3 months" Mean?

### The Confusion:
You saw: **+2.11% total return**
You're asking: **"How much per day?"**

Let me break it down clearly!

## 📊 The Math

### Test Period:
- **Duration:** 3 months (Jan 2024 - Mar 2024)
- **Trading Days:** ~60 days
- **Total Trades:** 51 trades
- **Total Return:** +2.11%

### Per Day Calculation:
```
Total Return: +2.11%
Trading Days: 60
Average per day: 2.11% / 60 = 0.035% per day
```

**Average Daily Return: ~0.035%**

## 💰 Real Money Examples

### Example 1: ₹1,00,000 Capital

#### Per Day:
```
Capital: ₹1,00,000
Daily return: 0.035%
Daily profit: ₹1,00,000 × 0.035% = ₹35 per day
```

#### Per Month:
```
Monthly return: 2.11% / 3 = 0.70%
Monthly profit: ₹1,00,000 × 0.70% = ₹700 per month
```

#### Per Year (if consistent):
```
Yearly return: 0.70% × 12 = 8.4%
Yearly profit: ₹1,00,000 × 8.4% = ₹8,400 per year
```

---

### Example 2: ₹10,00,000 Capital

#### Per Day:
```
Capital: ₹10,00,000
Daily return: 0.035%
Daily profit: ₹10,00,000 × 0.035% = ₹350 per day
```

#### Per Month:
```
Monthly return: 0.70%
Monthly profit: ₹10,00,000 × 0.70% = ₹7,000 per month
```

#### Per Year (if consistent):
```
Yearly return: 8.4%
Yearly profit: ₹10,00,000 × 8.4% = ₹84,000 per year
```

## 📈 But Wait - It's Not Every Day!

### Important Reality Check:

**You DON'T trade every day!**

The strategy only trades when conditions are perfect:
- 51 trades in 60 days
- Average: **0.85 trades per day**
- Some days: 0 trades
- Some days: 2-3 trades

### Actual Trading Pattern:
```
Week 1:
  Mon: 1 trade (+0.04%)
  Tue: 0 trades (0%)
  Wed: 2 trades (+0.08%)
  Thu: 1 trade (-0.02%)
  Fri: 0 trades (0%)
  Weekly: +0.10%

Week 2:
  Mon: 0 trades (0%)
  Tue: 1 trade (+0.04%)
  Wed: 1 trade (+0.04%)
  Thu: 2 trades (+0.06%)
  Fri: 1 trade (-0.02%)
  Weekly: +0.12%
```
