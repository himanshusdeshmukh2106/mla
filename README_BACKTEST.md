## üéØ Trading Rules

2. ‚úÖ ADX ‚â• 28 (strong trend)
3. ‚úÖ Time: 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM

- **Trailing Stop:** 0.30%
- **Max Holding:** 15 candles (75 minutes)

## üí° Why It Works

### The Math:
- Win 35.71% of the time: 10 trades √ó +0.47% = +4.72%
- Lose 64.29% of the time: 18 trades √ó -0.24% = -4.24%
- **Net Profit: +0.48%**

### The Key:
**We win TWICE as much as we lose (2:1 ratio)**

Even with a low win rate, the asymmetric risk/reward makes us profitable.
